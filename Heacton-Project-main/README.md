CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECT

Climate Change Website/Discord Bot Artificial Intelligence Introduction This website has been created to raise awareness about climate change, highlight the importance of environmental pollution and help individuals understand their impact on this global problem. Important information such as the history of climate change, information about environmental pollution, and how long various products have been lost in nature will be included on our website.

The History of Climate Change Climate change, 19. it is a topic that has been raised with scientific research since a century. The increasing use of fossil fuels, especially with industrialization, has led to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and a rapid increase in global temperatures. Since the 1950s, scientific evidence on climate change has increased, and in 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established within the United Nations, and this issue began to be addressed at the international level.

Importance of Environmental Pollution Environmental pollution is one of the main causes of climate change. Greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels lead to air pollution and global warming.Tue. This pollution has negative effects on both ecosystems and human health. On our website, you can find detailed information about the role of environmental pollution on climate change and what needs to be done to solve this problem.

Periods of Disappearance from Nature The periods of disappearance from nature of various products are critical for understanding the effects of environmental pollution. Below are the periods of disappearance of some common products in nature:

Plastic Bottle: 450 years Aluminum Box: 200 years Cigarette Butt: 1-5 years Glass Bottle: 1 million years Sachet: 10-20 years This information will help you understand the long-term effects of environmental pollution and increase your awareness of sustainability.

Effects on Living Things Climate change and environmental pollution have serious effects on living things. Ecosystems are deteriorating, biodiversity is declining, and many species are facing extinction. In addition, polluted air and water sources negatively affect human health.

Form and Artificial Intelligence Link There is a form on our website where users can calculate their own carbon footprints and their impact on global warming. By filling out this form, you can learn about your individual impacts on climate change and have information about the measures you can take in this regard.

In addition, an artificial intelligence link will also be included on our site for users who want to learn more about climate change. Through this link, you can ask your questions with an artificial intelligence-supported system and access detailed information.

Contributing Those who want to contribute to this project can share their suggestions and development ideas with us. Everyone's contribution is important to raise awareness about climate change and build a more sustainable future.
